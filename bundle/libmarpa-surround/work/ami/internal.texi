for is those working on the Libmarpa internals.

@chapter Internal Interface

Internal methods are only for testing and development of libmarpa.
They are listed here (and sometimes described) for the convenience
of those working on libmarpa's internals.

Internal methods are subject to radical change without notice.
Applications should not use internal methods.
If a description exists and might be helpful,
it may be included below.
Even so, all applications
should treat these methods as ``undocumented''.
