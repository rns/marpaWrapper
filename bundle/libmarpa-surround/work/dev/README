This is the developer's directory.  The distribution should *NOT*
be built in this directory -- instead files are copied to a staging
directory.  See the Makefile for details.

Special tools (such as Cweb) are required.  These tools are all free,
readily available, and highly portable.  *But* these tools are not
included.  It may not be easy or even possible to install all these
tools on some of the systems to which libmarpa, Marpa or Marpa::XS
can be ported.
