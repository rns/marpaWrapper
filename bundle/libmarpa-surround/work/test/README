Note As of Fri Dec 27 14:43:28 PST 2013:
The contents of these directories are largely obsolete.

This directory is for testing.
Actual testing happens in the build subdirectory.
The dev subdirectory holds the source of the test program.
The lib subdirectory is for building the version
of libmarpa to be used for testing.

The following instructions are probably out of date:

To install

1) mkdir dev/m4

2) (cd dev; autoreconf -ivf)

To build:

1) Change to the work directory

2) sh ../dev/configure

3) make
